<p>I've been using my unibody MacBook 2Ghz much more than usual lately as my iMac was being repaired and I was lamenting the absence of backlit keys on it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As I was looking into the iFixit guide on how to remove the logic board for an unrelated reason,
I happened onto this <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/9617/Is+backlit+keyboard+compatible+with+MacBook%21#answer41982">post</a> where I learned that I could just buy 
a backlight sheet and add it into my Macbook without having to replace the whole upper case. It was also much cheaper than I expected; only 10€ delivered 
(took a couple of weeks from HK). You can find it on ebay searching for the part number or just the part name.</p>

<p>There is one caveat, not all Macbook A1278 motherboards do have this connector, even if only 30% do not have it. Here is some photos as an example: <a href="http://guide-images.ifixit.net/igi/OheOqOn6lNyjKCSM.huge">with</a>, <a href="http://guide-images.ifixit.net/igi/qlImGnIwwSPLGcnO.huge">without</a>.</p>

<p>It took a couple of week for the original, new part to arrive from Hong-Kong, I then proceeded to test it quickly to check if everything was working as expected:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IUfJR.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p>After plugging it in with the laptop powered down (obviously), I started it, logged in remotely and used <a href="http://labtick.proculo.de/">Labtick</a> to manually switch 
the backlight on.</p>

<p>The blue fringe around the sheet is the adhesive cover, there is a tab to remove it prior installation.</p>

<p>Installation was fairly straightforward, even if it involves removing pretty much all the internals, 
it's not difficult to do on a unibody. Using <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Device/MacBook_Unibody_Model_A1278">iFixit Guide</a> it's just a matter of following the instructions. 
I also used this occasion to give the radiator and fan a good cleaning.</p>

<p>So here is it, even if this is mostly a cosmetic hack that needs a fair amount of time to install, I hope that some people here will find this interesting.
This also might be applicable to other Macbook that have a backlit keyboard as an option.</p>
